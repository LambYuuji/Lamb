I've decided to make a read.me here, as I don't want to keep switching accounts and moreso.

# This, is ranting me about DID/systems, and my personal associations with them. Interact however you like if you're a system, but please, be cautious around me. I won't explain everything in detail.

I've had a bad history with system people, not good, not neutral, bad. I won't mention any of disgusting stuff I did on my other account, since that may be triggering.

Let's just start with something simple; I've had many friends or known people who had DID/were systems. Most of them were bad. None of them were good, but that's just my bad luck meeting the wrong people, I guess.

I found out what systems were and what DID was when I was 10. Ten years old. I was a child, back then.

I've had two friends that had DID and were systems. Had alot of alters, bad ones, neutral ones and ''good'' ones. One, was an adult, whilst the other *was* reaching their adulthood. It was highkey crazy, not gonna lie. Imagine flirting with a minor whilst you're an adult and reaching adulthood, same to your alters. Hilarious, honestly.

Most of them lied, manipulated or tried to groom me even. I had to deal with their stuff also, when I wasn't even functioning normally back then; I was really distressed and in my bad state for a long time. If you asked me why I didn't block them, trust me, I tried to. They would leak ALL of my private and personal information EVERYWHERE. I was terrified, scared, I was a child, CHILD. TEN YEARDS OLD.

When I was 13-14, I got a boyfriend, who was also a system. Let's just say, we lasted 2 months before things went downhill. He did gross stuff to me, forced me to do things I didn't want to; insulted all of my friends and even said that he'll cheat on me with someone else better than me or something, I really can't remember. It was a NIGHTMARE with him. If I tried to break up with them, they'd guilt trip me (I did that once, we got together back again) or they'd threaten to leak my information. Luckily, I managed to break up with them without any of my information getting leaked.

It was a hellish roller coaster; I even cut ties with other people who had DID and were systems. It gave me a heavy distrust to people with DID/ to people who are systems. I honestly think that NOT all systems are like this, but I still do not trust them. I do hope my ex and other ex-friends that were systems are doing good, I just hope they aren't doing any bad stuff to other people.

It is not that much information, but it is the most I could've thought of without it being disgusting.
